its a annonymus function .
when u wanty to use func without func name there we apply concept of lamda function.



Write a program after creating a list with even nos within the range 1 - 15 now apply lambda function and create a new list, which shuld hv sqrt of the elem.


4 pillars of oops
1.abstraction
2.encapsulation
3.inheritence
4.polymorphism

1. hiding the implementation part showing , wht is req for the users .
ex: exe file , we can make class or method as abstract , opp to abstract is concrete

2.Binding the data and func into single entity
public --------> class info can be accessed
private--------> class info cannot accessed 
protected------>can be accesed where it is declared whichever class inherited from this class there also we can use it.

3.derived class will accquire properities of base class
   -->single
   -->multiple
   -->multilevel
  --->hirearichal
  --->hybrid
